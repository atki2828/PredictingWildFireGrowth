*Try to predict which wildfires will grow in size between first contact and containment


*Perform EDA on Alberta Wild Fire Data from 1996 - 2002


*Build K fold Cross Validation Class in order to compare SK learn Classifiers


*Tune Parameters for KNN, SVM, RandomForest usive gridsearch

*Compare KNN, SVM, RandomForest and Logistic Regression

*Use K fold Cross Validation Class to compare models

*Decide which model performed best based on misclassification rate and Recall
